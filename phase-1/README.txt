till here what we have done is to write a function that send specific command from MCU to df-player 
the command that we tried was to play first song of a list 
this step has been done successfully 
at phase-1 the aim is to write a function to take the query from df-player 
it can be initilization query that df-player sends when it turns on correctly or any other query like errors when sth goes wrong 
in order to make it more efficient we don't really need to have predefined answer to every queries like errors or ... 
we just make sure that the query is correctly recieved
