## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to create an interactive toy equipped with six distinct buttons, each representing a specific emotion - happiness, sadness, embarrassment, and more. The underlying premise of this research is rooted in the belief that when individuals can formally recognize and label their emotions, they are better equipped to manage their feelings and make informed decisions.

## Why EmoSense?
EmoSense aims to empower children by helping them understand and identify their emotions. By offering a tangible means to express their feelings, the device not only encourages emotional intelligence but also provides tailored solutions for different emotional states.

## Key Features
* Six Emotion Buttons: EmoSense includes six dedicated buttons, each linked to a unique emotion. Users can select the button that best represents how they feel at a given moment, thereby promoting emotional self-awareness.

* Emotional Guidance: Beyond recognizing emotions, EmoSense provides guidance and solutions tailored to the selected emotion. This feature equips users, especially children, with tools to manage their feelings more effectively.

## Getting Started
To get started with EmoSense, follow these simple steps:

1. Power on the device.
2. Choose the button that corresponds to your current emotion.
3. Benefit from personalized guidance to navigate your emotional state.
